# droid_ REQUIREMENTS

### 1. STEP ONE - CREATE APP TEMPLATE
Start with creating a responsive app template based on received materials. Feel free to use any technology of your choice. At this stage, we mainly expect good HTML/CSS skills, but using style libraries and toolkits is allowed too.

### 2. STEP 2 - SPA
Implement routing. A user should be able to navigate through the page smoothly, without reloading. Our main focus in this step is your Javascript skills - knowledge of frameworks (Vue, React, Angular) is appreciated, but not mandatory.

### 3. STEP 3 - API
Now, letâ€™s focus on API. Use any data of your choice to create and display the grid layout. Each card should contain an image, title, and description. After clicking on any item, the product detail should appear. The user should be able to add a chosen product to the cart. Note that your project does not have to be the exact copy of the example app.

Good interaction design provides feedback - remember to display loading indicator while downloading product cards.

Cart and price total should update without reloading the page.
